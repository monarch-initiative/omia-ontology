name: cerebellar abiotrophy
def: "Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA), also referred to as the cerebellar cortical abiotrophy (CCA), which is a genetic neurological disease in animals best known to affect certain breeds of horses and dogs. It develops when the neurons known as Purkinje cells, located in the cerebellum of the brain, begin to die off. These cells affect balance and coordination. They have a critical role to play in the brain. The Purkinje layer allows communication between the granular and molecular cortical layers in the cerebellum. Put simply, without Purkinje cells, an animal loses its sense of space and distance, making balance and coordination difficult." [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellar_abiotrophy]
comment: In most cases, the Purkinje neurons begin to die off shortly after the animal is born and the condition is noticeable when the animal is less than six months old, though sometimes the onset of symptoms is gradual and the animal is much older before the owner or caretaker notices a problem.

name: collie eye anomaly
def: "Collie eye anomaly (CEA) is a congenital, inherited, bilateral eye disease of dogs, which affects the retina, choroid, and sclera. It can be a mild disease or cause blindness. CEA is caused by a simple autosomal recessive gene defect. There is no treatment." [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collie_eye_anomaly]
comment: CEA is caused by improper development of the eye. Failure of the cells of the posterior portion of the optic vesicles to express growth hormone affects the differentiation of other cells of the eye. The choroid, especially lateral to the optic disc, is hypoplastic (underdeveloped). A coloboma, or hole, may form in or near the optic disc due to a failed closure of embryonic tissue. The degree of these abnormalities varies between individual dogs, and even between the same dog's eyes[WP]

def: "This disorder is of particular interest in cattle, because it is one of the few cases in which an embryonic lethal has been identified. (By their very nature, embryonic lethals are difficult to identify; their only manifestation is a return to service.) To date, the only known cause of this disorder in cattle is a nonsense mutation in codon 405 of the UMPS gene, resulting in a complete deficiency of functional UMPS (Schwenger et al., 1993). Since nucleotides are required in such vast quantities during embryonic development, it is not surprising that homozygosity for the nonsense mutation results in embryonic death around 40 days in utero. The practical effect of this disorder is that carrier cows show a higher rate of return to service, because some of their pregnancies end in early natural abortion. Given that returns to service can have so many different causes, it would not have been possible to identify the mutation from reproductive records. How, then, was this embryonic lethal mutation detected initially? The answer is: by chance! As part of a nutrition study at the University of Illinois, the level of orotic acid was determined in the milk of cows in the university herd. Some cows had exceptionally high levels of this acid, and one possible explanation was that they were deficient in UMPS. Subsequent biochemical tests showed that these cows had only 50% of the normal activity of this enzyme (reviewed by Shanks and Robinson, 1990). Inheritance and molecular studies finally brought the whole story to light." [OMIA:000262]

The DNA copy is called ev21 (endogenous viral gene number 21), and is inherited like any host gene. The difference between K- and kk chickens is discernible immediately after hatching.

Sheep from this flock were studied by the CSIRO (Helen Turner, Laurie Piper, Bernie Bindon and colleagues), and it was eventually shown that the prolificacy of the Booroola strain was due to a single gene of large effect, which acts additively for both ovulation rate and litter size (Piper and Bindon, 1982; Davis et al., 1982; Piper et al., 1985). The difference between homozygotes is approximately 2.7-3.0 in ovulation rate and 1.1-1.7 in litter size. The genetical and physiological basis of the Booroola's prolificacy was also studied extensively by New Zealand researchers, who provided one of the first examples of the practical application of gene mapping in sheep, by mapping the Booroola gene to chromosome 6 (Montgomery et al., 1993, 1994), as described in the Mapping section below."

In a segregation analysis of data from a Cheviot flock into which the Thoka gene was introduced via Icelandic rams, Walling et al. (2002) confirmed the existence of a gene of large effect on fecundity, but there was some evidence that this gene was present in the flock before the Icelandic introduction.

def: "The typical feathering of hens is part of their secondary sexual characteristics, produced by the action of oestrogen. Much of this oestrogen is produced from androgen in the ovaries by the enzyme aromatase. In certain strains of two breeds of chicken, namely the Sebright Bantam and the Golden Campine, roosters have the same feathering as hens, rather than the typical male form of feathering. This disorder is called henny feathering. It results from a mutation in the aromatase gene, causing the gene to be expressed in the skin of both sexes. In males, this leads to abnormally high levels of oestrogen, which in turn produces henny feathering. Henny feathering is interesting because it illustrates that not all mutations result in loss of activity; some mutations can cause a gene to be switched on in cells in which it is normally inactive."

def: "Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is an endocrine disorder characterized by inadequate T4 levels early in life concurrent with signs of hypothyroidism.  Disease can be primary (failure to make T4), which is due to abnormal thyroid development or function.  Primary hypothyroidism often presents with goiter but can be due to thyroid dysgenesis.  CH can be secondary (failure to make bioactive TSH), which is caused by abnormal pituitary development or function.  CH can also be tertiary (failure to make TRH) due to abnormal hypothalamic function.   Signs of CH with goiter include growth retardation (dwarfism), epiphyseal dysplasia in the vertebrae and limbs, and delay in maturation changes such as dental eruption, opening of eyes and ear canals, and growth of guard hairs.  Other signs include thickened subcutis, lethargy, unresponsiveness, and failure to suckle.  The disorder is lethal unless diagnosed and treated early. Goiter, extremely low T4, and increased TSH are signs in Toy Fox Terriers, Rat Terriers, Tenterfield Terriers, and Spanish Water Dogs.   The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive.  The causative mutations in the 3 terrier breeds and the Spanish water dog are all in the gene that codes for thyroid peroxidase (TPO), the enzyme responsible for irreversible binding of iodide to thyroglobulin.  This process is known as organification of iodide, and it is a necessary step of thyroid hormone synthesis.  If thyroid peroxidase activity is not present, the animal is unable to make T4 and presents with primary hypothyroidism. Goiter develops as thyroid cells undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia due to unrelenting TSH stimulation. A DNA-based test is available to detect the mutation in all 4 breeds. Breeding of carrier animals to each other is not recommended.  If a carrier animal is bred to a homozygous normal animal, testing the offspring is advised.    Edited by John C.

comment: In pigs, malignant hyperthermia (MH) leads to rapid post-mortem changes in muscle, resulting in pale soft exudative (PSE) meat. MH can be triggered by a minor stress, such as loading, transport, sexual intercourse, high ambient temperature, or exposure to the anaesthetic halothane. Susceptibility to halothane-induced MH is an autosomal recessive trait in pigs. Together, sudden death syndrome and PSE constitute porcine stress syndrome (PSS), which became a major economic problem in many countries in the 1970s, as indicated by the number of references in the list below. In part, the increasing problem of PSS was due to strong selection for increased leanness, which is associated with susceptibility to PSS. [OMIA:000621]

The disease is caused by a deficiency of activity of the mitochondrial enzyme branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKADH). This deficiency leads to elevated concentrations of branched chain alpha-keto acids and their precursors, the branched chain amino acids, valine, leucine and isoleucinein in blood and tissues.

One of the calves died with ruptured aorta at age 16 months. Histopathologic and electron microscopic studies of the aortic media of these calves demonstrated disorganized elastin and narrowed elastic lamina separated by widened spaces. Parsons et al. (1992) with biochemical analyses on two calves with bovine Marfan syndrome showed that  in contrast to elastin, collagen in aortae of Marfan calves was significantly higher than the mean of several controls These authors concluded that the microscopic and biochemical lesions of aortic elastin in bovine Marfan syndrome is likely due to defective microfibrillar metabolism. Absence of cystic medial necrosis in bovine Marfan aortae may explain normal elastin content in the animal model. Potter et al. 1993 reported that Bovine Marfan syndrome is closely related to its humanâs counterpart in its clinical signs and pathological lesions, suggesting similar metabolic defects for its cause. Major manifestations include ectopia lentis and aortic dilatation, aneurysm, and rupture. Similar to humans, affected cows have a defect in fibrillin metabolism (Potter et al. 1994). Potter et al. 1993 suggested that the bovine Marfan syndrome, like the human disorder, is caused by a mutation in fibrillin, leading to defective microfibrillar synthesis (Mohammad Shariflou 6/11/2006). </field>" [OMIA:000628]

def: "The double-muscle trait in cattle is characterised by an increase in muscle mass of approx 20%, resulting in substantially higher meat yield, a higher proportion of expensive cuts of meat, and lean and very tender meat, for which a substantial premium is paid. The trait is autosomal recessive, and the locus has been given the symbol mh. It occurs at such a high frequency in Piedmontese and Belgian Blue cattle that it is characteristic of these breeds. However, it also occurs in other breeds. Along with its obvious advantages, double-muscling also has one major drawback - a greatly increased incidence of calving difficulties, to the extent that Caesarian sections are the rule for deliveries within these breeds. However, its advantages are sufficient that double-muscled cattle play a major role in animal agriculture in several countries, and are found in many countries. A genome scan using 213 mapped microsatellite markers in a Belgian Blue X Friesian backcross, conducted by Charlier et al. (1995), showed that the mh locus is at the centromeric end of chromosome 2, approximately 3.1 cM from microsatellite TCLA44. In mid 1997, McPherron et al. (1997) published the results of investigations into the gene for myostatin, a member of the transforming-growth-factor-beta-1 superfamily of peptides: mice in which the myostatin gene had been &quot;knocked out&quot; have a phenotype very similar to double-muscling. This immediately suggested a &quot;candidate&quot; gene for mh. Before long, both physical and linkage mapping had shown that myostatin maps to the mh region of bovine chromosome 2 (Grobet et al., 1997; Smith et al., 1997), making it a very likely candidate for the mh gene. Then, sequencing of myostatin DNA from homozygous normals and double-muscled cattle revealed an 11-bp deletion (of nucleotides 821 to 831), resulting in a frameshift and subsequent premature termination, in the bioactive carboxy-terminal domain of the gene in Belgian Blue cattle (Grobet et al., 1997; Kambadur et al., 1997; McPherron and Lee, 1997). This is a region that is very highly conserved in the TGF family of peptides. The same mutation is responsible for double-muscling in the Asturiana breed (Grobet et al. 1998; Georges et al., 1998). In contrast, double-muscled Piedmontese cattle have a G-A transition that changes a cysteine residue to a tyrosine in the same highly-conserved region of the gene (Kambadur et al., 1997; McPherron and Lee, 1997). In a screen of 35 double-muscled cattle from 10 European breeds, seven different sequence variants (alleles) were discovered in the coding region of the myostatin gene (Grobet et al., 1998; Georges et al., 1998). Five of these could cause a deficiency of myostatin: the 11bp deletion already described; an insertion/deletion in which 10 unrelated bases are inserted in the place a 7 bases that have been deleted at nucleotide 418; a C-T transition at nucleotide 610; a G-T transversion at nucleotide 676; and a G-A transition at nucleotide 938. Two other mutants were unlikely to cause a deficiency: a C-A transversion at nucleotide 282 (resulting in a conservative Phe-Leu amino-acid substitution); and a silent C-T transition at nucleotide 414. For most of the breeds, double-muscled animals were homozygous for one of the five harmful mutations, or were compound heterozygotes for two mutants. Obviously, there is considerable genetical heterogeneity in the cause of double muscling. Furthermore, the mutations are not all unique to one breed: two are shared by more than one breed. In addition, two breeds (Limousin and Blond d'Aquitane) have double-muscling but do not have any of the five harmful mutations. Clearly, there are more harmful mutations to be discovered. More importantly, the discovery that mutations in the myostatin gene have a profound effect on meat yield and quality opens the way for elucidating the role of myostatin in meat production, which in turn will suggest novel (possibly non-genetic) ways of enhancing meat yield and quality."

def: "This disease has been recognised in sheep for many centuries. The name arises from the common practice of affected sheep rubbing (scraping) against fence posts. In sheep, the PrP gene is about 20 kb long, consisting of three exons encoding a peptide comprising approximately 250 amino acids. Extensive polymorphism has been discovered in codons 136, 154 and 171, giving rise to amino-acid substitutions at these sites. There is substantial evidence that at least some of this polymorphism is strongly associated with susceptibility/resistance to scrapie. The most likely explanation for this association is that some amino-acid sequences are able to form themselves into the infectious agent, PrP(superscript Sc), without the intervention of other PrP(superscript Sc) particles. Although having been studied for decades, scrapie has been the centre of intense scientific and political attention since 1988, when bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease) was recognised as a new disease, apparently having arisen from the practice of feeding insufficiently-heated sheep offal to cattle. On the strength of the associations mentioned above, The National Scrapie Plan for Britain commenced in January 2002 (Arnold et al., 2002). This is a large program that involves genotyping breeding stock for the three polymorphims within the PrP gene, and issuing certificates on the basis of the genotyping. Similar schemes are underway in France and the Netherlands [FN 13 Jan 2003]" [OMIA:000944]

Most of the documentation, however, concerns its occurrence in US Holsteins, where, as a result of the siring of more than 60,000 calves by a bull who was subsequently shown to be a carrier, the disorder attracted considerable attention (Anon., 1967). The possibility that artificial selection favouring heterozygotes may have contributed to the unacceptably high frequency of the disorder was suggested by data showing that carrier females produced on average 2.1 pounds of butterfat and 298 pounds of milk more than homozygotes (Leipold et al., 1973). Progeny testing of males (Johnson et al., 1980) and females (Leipold and Peeples, 1981) was the main means of identifying carriers until Charlier et al. (1996) used a genome-wide set of DNA markers in an identity-by descent linkage study to show that the syndactyly gene is located on chromosome 15." [OMIA:000963]

In longissimus dorsi muscles, carriers of this dominant gene show lower pH, higher surface and internal reflectance values, lower protein extractability, lower water-holding capacity, lower Napole yield (yield after curing and cooking), and greater cooking loss. On the positive side, carriers have a lower shear force value, a stronger taste and smell, and greater acidity. The primary cause of these differences is that the mutant allele results in higher stored glycogen content in muscle." [OMIA:001085]

Affected calves have a reduced weight, a misshapen backbone and tendon contractions in the legs. Several other malformations including heart malformations are associated with this syndrome. A DNA test is available in Denmark and the Netherlands. [Imke Tammen: 26 Jan 2002] From a study of 62,602 inseminations involving carrier bulls and daughters of carrier bulls, Nielsen et al. (2003) concluded that 77% of affected foetuses are aborted prior to day 260 of gestation, which is the earliest day from which cases have been diagnosed. This means that approximately 3/4 of affected foetuses are not diagnosed by necropsy [FN: 10 Jan 2003]" [OMIA:001340]

def: "This trait was first reported in sheep by Cockett et al. (1994), who showed that the locus at which this potentially advantageous mutation occurred is on chromosome 18, near the non-centromeric end. The mutant allele leads to increased protein synthesis and decreased protein degradation. The practical effects include higher dressing percentage, reduced fat thickness, and reduced marbling, while carcass weight is not affected (Koohmaraie et al., 1995; 1996; Carpenter et al., 1996). Overall, callipyge lambs have a distinct advantage in retail yield and carcass conformation (Jackson et al., 1997b), with the increased muscle mass being concentrated in the leg and loin (Jackson et al., 1997c). Jackson et al. (1997a) showed that callipyge lambs have a lower feed intake than non-callipyge lambs, but the same growth rate. Consequently, callipyge lambs have a superior feed efficiency. Greasy fleece weight and staple length of callipyge lambs were slightly lower." [OMIA:001354]

Current evidence suggests that dogs that have two copies of the mutant gene are affected with MLS, though the severity of clinical signs can be variable. Dogs inheriting only one copy of the mutant gene can show subtle signs but do not appear to have health-related defects. To the best available knowledge, carriers cannot be identified based on their appearance." [http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/MLS.php]

Lethargy, exercise intolerance, and collapse after exercise may become apparent by 14 months of age. Dogs with GSD IIIa are deficient in glycogen debranching enzyme, so instead of breaking down glycogen into glucose, they accumulate abnormal glycogen particles.  This mostly happens in liver and muscle, which are the tissues that have the highest levels of glycogen metabolism. The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive. The causative mutation is an adenosine deletion causing premature termination of AGL translation. A test is available to detect the mutation. Parents and siblings of affected dogs should be tested.  Breeding of affected animals is not recommended.  If a carrier must be bred, it is advised to breed that dog only to a dog that has tested as homozygous normal.  Edited by John C.
